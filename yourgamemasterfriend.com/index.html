<h1>Your Game Master Friend</h1>

<h2> My name is Z, and I have been running tabletop roleplaying games for over a decade and a half. </h2>
  <h3>My time as a Game Master has been fraught with exciting tales of heroism and brutal betrayals. In my opinion player characters come first, and I use a system closely aligned
  to Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master by Michael Shea with augmented preparation for the not so lazy dungeon master in me.
  I enjoy the act of world building, and watching as my players explore out from their tiny corner of reality into something grand and beautiful.</h3>

<h2> Hearth and Home </h2>
  <h3> Home is indeed where the heart is, and sharing it with my friends is one of my favorite parts of hosting a tabletop game.
    It is often a group ritual to gather a small potluck dinner to share while we roll dice, and tell stories together.
    It is my hope that you find helpful hints and tips for running your own games, and can share in these precious moments.
